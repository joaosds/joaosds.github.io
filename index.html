  <li><p style="text-align:justify"> <b>November 2021</b>: I had an amazing weekend participating in my first hackathon ever, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/McGill"> McGill Physics Hackathon 2021</a> alongside my amazing friends Pedro Cintra, Felipe Fontinele (who was the mastermind behind the plan and GR calculations!), Igor Reis and Vitor Dantas. We received the "First Place", "People's choice" and the "Astroprize" awards! It was really fun and I'm thankful for the amazing job the organizers did to make this an enjoyable and challenging experience!
  Our work about general relativistic corrections to the three-body problem can be found on this devpost page: <a target="_blank" href="https://devpost.com/software/general-relativistic-three-body-simulator"> Relativistic Three-Body simulator</a>. </p> </li>
  <li><p style="text-align:justify"> <b>September 2021</b>: I was recently selected to the academic excellence prize "Yvonne Primerano Mascarenhas" for my Master's work on <i>"Chiral spin liquids on the kagome Lattice" </i> with my advisor Eric C. Andrade and our collaborators Fabrizio G. Oliviero and
  Rodrigo G. Pereira at <a target="_blank" href="https://sifsc.ifsc.usp.br/">SIFSC 11.</a> Really grateful for the opportunity to present my work to Prof. Yvonne Mascarenhas, an inspiring scientist responsible for the consolidation of Brazilian Science in many aspects such as the creation of IFSC-USP. The presentation can be seen
