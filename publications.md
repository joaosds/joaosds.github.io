<h3>Investigating spin liquids via projected wavefunctions</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify">Spin liquids are exquisite states of matter which host fractionalized excitations of spin and show no long-range magnetic order even at zero temperature due to quantum fluctuations. They have been extensively studied using fractionalized representations of the spin degrees of freedom in the so-called parton construction in conjunction with the Gutzwiller projection. Using Mean Field Theories (MFT), this constraint can be imposed on average, and numerical techniques, such as the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) are required to impose the condition exactly at each site. In this framework, the VMC is a powerful tool to indicate which MFT ansatz is favored energetically to represent the spin liquid state based on the variational principle and the specific spin fractionalized representation. We employed this approach to investigate a putative chiral spin liquid state in the Kagome lattice using the Abrikosov representation which can host spinons: neutral spin-1/2 fermionic quasiparticles. This work was performed in the J1 − Jd − Jχ Kagome Lattice model, and it was inspired by experimental results from the material α − Cu3Zn (OH)6 Cl2 (kapellasite) - a polymorphous structure of ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 (herbertsmithite) - with no long-range order down to T = 20mK. Our VMC results favor a gapless chiral spin liquid with staggered flux ±π/2 over the triangles and 0 flux on the hexagons in the region with Jd/ |Jχ| > 0 for small |J1| < 0.1. We also investigated the stability of this spin-liquid state to ordered phases known to occur in the model. In addition, new non-coplanar ordered phases were encountered via the gradient descent method in the limit of S » 1 which may be relevant for ordered Kagome materials. By representing the influence of the ordered phases via a fictitious Zeeman field in a spin density wave (SDW) ansatz for the VMC, we have found consistent results with our classical phase diagram, establishing a more realistic region for the spin liquid domain. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/76/76134/tde-06042022-111534/pt-br.php">View PDF here.</a></div>

<h3>Decay of accelerated fermions, Unruh Effect and applications in the semi-classical regime</h3>
<font size=2><b>J.A.S. Silva</b>. Supervisor: <a targe="_blank" href="https://www.fis.unb.br/index.php?option=com_myjspace&view=see&pagename=clovis">C. A. S. Maia.</a> Universidade de Brasília.</font>
<div style="text-align: justify">In an introduction to quantum field theory, brief notions in curved spaces and to the
phenomenology of elementary particles, a revision work was developed focusing on the
comprehension of the Unruh Effect in its necessity for the consistency of quantum field
theory itself when considering the decay of uniformly accelerated fermions, both in an
inertial reference frame and in the Rindler wedge frame. Considering particles through
the formalism of semi-classical currents, another topic of study was the influence of gravitational fields in cooling mechanisms of neutron stars and the possibility of detecting
particles that do not obey the famous dispersion relation in Earth’s vicinity. <a target="_blank" href="../files/undergrad-thesis-joao.pdf">View PDF here.</a></div>

<h3>Instrumentation for the Study of the Electrocaloric and the Electrostrictive Effcts</h3>
<font size=2><b>J.P. Valeriano</b>. Supervisor: A.M.G. Carvalho, Co-supervisor: L.S.O. Paixão, LNLS/CPNEM.</font>
<div size=2 style="text-align: justify">Project developed during 2018 <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.cnpem.br/bolsasdeverao/">CNPEM Summer Scholarships Program</a>.</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify">This report presents the beginning of instrumentation development
for the study the electrocaloric effect and the electrostriction of samples of PVDF and PMN–10PT, by the research groups of the XRD1 beamline and the i-Caloric Materials Lab (LMiC), at LNLS, at CNPEM. Attempts were made to measure electrocalori effect directly, with a thermocouple directly attached to the samples, but no temperature variation was observed with the electric fields application. The prototype of a modified Sawyer–Tower circuit was developed to measure electric polarization, that still needs improvements to operate with the low capacitance samples, and will allow indirect measurements of temperature and entropy variations related to the electrocaloric effect. Electrostriction measurements were made through X ray diffraction with changing electric fields, and small strain results were obtained for the PVDF. <a target="_blank" href="../files/Relatorio_28o_PBV-joao_valeriano.pdf">View PDF here.</a></div>
