<h1 style="color: #00203FFF;"> Hi and Welcome! :) </h1>
<!--
<p style="text-align:justify"> I'm a physics master's student at (<a href="https://www2.ifsc.usp.br/english/">IFSC</a>) at the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil, currently working on the study of spin liquids using numerical and analytical techniques such as the Variational Monte Carlo and mean field theories. In general, my research interests lie on understanding how complex and unique phenomena may emerge from interactions between <i>(almost)</i> fundamental blocks of nature, i.e., quasiparticles and particles; for this challenging endeavor, we use established theoretical and computational methods in physics. I'm also deeply interested in the development of new numerical techniques in the context of many-body physics.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> For educational purposes, after working with a diverse public for five years I discovered that I really enjoy teaching and developing innovative solutions for teaching physics in a more interesting way. There's nothing better than kindly helping others through education. Apart from Academia and in a methodological sense, software development and data analysis in a broader scope are 'my cup of tea'.   </p>

<p align="justify"> In my spare time, I find comfort in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117614351-jo-o-augusto-sobral-da-silva">reading</a>, cooking, playing classical and soundtrack pieces on the acoustic guitar, and gazing Nature.
