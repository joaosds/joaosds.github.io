title: About 
---


<p align="justify"> I'm currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.itp3.uni-stuttgart.de/">ITP III</a>. I devote my time to understand, at different levels, how complex and unique phenomena may emerge from interactions between <i>(almost)</i> fundamental blocks of nature. I'm also deeply interested in developing, extending and applying numerical techniques in the context of physical sciences. </p>
